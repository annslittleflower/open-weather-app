# weather app

`nvm i`

`nvm use`

`npm run dev`

**beware**

- openweathermap api key activates 2 hours after registration

## TODO

- city partial search doesnot work, user needs to type city 100% correctly
- a11y and semantics are currently sad
- hardcoded celsius temperature
- button inside a looks bad
- fix cities[0] from request, make dropdown menu showing all 5 cities from api
- tests
